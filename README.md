# Build a Recipe Discovery API with Architecture Patterns 

Learn to build a production-ready Recipe Discovery API using FastAPI and Python. This project demonstrates the evolution from monolithic code to well-architected services through progressive refactoring. You'll work with client personas to gather requirements, implement basic CRUD functionality, integrate external APIs, add caching with Redis, and refactor to clean, testable architecture patterns.
